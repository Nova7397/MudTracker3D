#Installation Guide for Data Rating scripts
To set up the necessary libraries, follow these steps:

1. Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

    Create a new virtual environment to keep your dependencies organized:
    bash
    Copy code:
    python -m venv env

2. Activate the virtual environment:
    Windows:
    bash
    Copy code
    .\env\Scripts\activate

    macOS/Linux:
    bash
    Copy code:
    source env/bin/activate

3.Install Dependencies

    Use the requirements.txt file to install the libraries:
    bash
    Copy code:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    Verify Installation

3. After installation, you can check the libraries are installed by running:
    bash
    Copy code
    pip freeze
This will confirm the required libraries and versions are ready to use for the scripts.
