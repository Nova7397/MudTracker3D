    "## Canny Edge Detection\n",
    "This script performs Canny edge detection on an image, with interactive threshold control, and saves the output if desired.\n",

    "### Setup\n",
    "Folder Structure:\n",
    "Select raw images in \\Rating pics\\Raw_file\n",
    "Output images will be saved in \\Rating pics\\Edge_detection\\A1.4\\\n",
    "#### Sample results have been saved in \\Rating pics\\Edge_detection\\A1.4\\ for reference\n",

    "## (Overhang) Edge Angle Detection Script\n",
    "This script detects overhang angles in a 3D printing image using Hough Line Transform. Detected lines are drawn, and their angles are labeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "Dependencies: Make sure the following libraries are installed:\n",
    "    opencv-python\n",
    "    numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works\n",
    "    Load Image: Reads the grayscale image and resizes it for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Detect Lines: Uses the Hough Line Transform to detect lines in the binary image.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Filter Lines: Removes redundant lines based on a specified angle tolerance (default is ±5°).\n",
    "\n",
    "Display and Save Results:\n",
    "Draws detected lines in red.\n",
    "Annotates the angle of each line in green text.\n",
    "Display: Shows the final image with detected lines and angles in a new window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Parameters\n",
    "distance_resolution: Pixel resolution for Hough Line accumulator (1 pixel).\n",
    "angle_resolution: Angle resolution in radians (1 degree).\n",
    "threshold: Minimum votes needed to detect a line (default is 40).\n",
    "Adjust these values to refine line detection as needed.\n",

    "## Area Calculation\n",
    "To calculate the total area covered by pure white regions in images, specifically for assessing overhang deviation and zigzag straightness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "Dependencies: Ensure you have OpenCV and NumPy installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Details\n",
    "calculate_white_area(image_path)\n",
    "Inputs: Path to the image file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process:\n",
    "Loads the image and creates a mask for pure white pixels ((255, 255, 255)).\n",
    "Counts the number of white pixels (area).\n",
    "Calculates the total area of the image.\n",
    "Computes the percentage of the image that is pure white.\n",
    "Returns: The white area in pixels and as a percentage of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output\n",
    "Running the script displays:\n",
    "\n",
    "Area of pure white color: [calculated pixels] pixels\n",
    "Percentage of pure white color: [calculated percentage]%\n",

    "## Rating Assessment\n",
    "## Data Visualization\n",
    "We use this script to visualize prototype ratings data through heatmaps, parallel coordinates, pair plots, and 3D scatter plots, providing insights into various print quality scores like overhang, zigzag, and freeform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "Dependencies: Install the following packages if not already available:\n",
    "    pandas\n",
    "    seaborn\n",
    "    matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plots and Visualizations\n",
    "1. Heatmaps of Scores\n",
    "For each score type (Overhang, Zigzag, and Freeform), a heatmap is created.\n",
    "The heatmaps display how scores vary based on Layer_height and Extrusion_rate.\n",
    "![Rating assessment/Heatmap.png](Rating assessment/Heatmap.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Parallel Coordinates Plot\n",
    "Shows patterns across scores for each combination of Layer_height and Extrusion_rate.\n",
    "This plot helps in visualizing the relationships and trends across different score types.\n",
    "![Rating assessment/Parallell Coordinates.png](Rating assessment/Parallell Coordinates.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Pair Plot\n",
    "Provides pairwise relationships between all variables in the data.\n",
    "Useful for identifying correlations and trends between scores and the parameters.\n",
    "![Rating assessment/Comparison between different factors.png](Rating assessment/Comparison between different factors.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. 3D Scatter Plot\n",
    "Visualizes the relationship between Layer_height, Extrusion_rate, and the Overhang score.\n",
    "Offers a spatial perspective to observe how the overhang score is affected by the other two parameters."
