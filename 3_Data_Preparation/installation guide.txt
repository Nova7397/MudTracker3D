#Installation Guide
1. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`

2. Install dependencies: Use the requirements.txt file for easy installation:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Additional Notes:

The libraries os, shutil, and random are part of Python’s standard library and do not require separate installation.
Ensure you’re using Python 3.6 or above for compatibility with these packages. We have used Python 3.12.7 for Data Preparation

4. Run your code: After installing the requirements, you’re all set to run your code.
