    "# TIMELAPSE DATA COLLECTION FOR WASP 3D PRINTER\n",
    "This script captures photos at regular intervals during a 3D print process and logs the associated G-code instructions. \n",
    "The script communicates with a 3D printer through OctoPrint, retrieves the current G-code being executed, captures images \n",
    "of the printing process, and saves the data to a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "    -Captures a photo every second during printing and saves it to a specified folder.\n",
    "    -Logs each photo's file location, timestamp, and current G-code command to a CSV file.\n",
    "    -Rotates images if necessary for correct orientation.\n",
    "    -Checks the printer’s status periodically and starts the timelapse when printing begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "Python Libraries: Make sure to install the following packages:\n",
    "    -requests for API communication with OctoPrint.\n",
    "    -picamera2 and libcamera for Raspberry Pi camera control.\n",
    "    -Pillow for image rotation.\n",
    "OctoPrint: The 3D printer should be set up with OctoPrint for remote monitoring and control.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "    -Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.\n",
    "    -Update the following variables in the script:\n",
    "        API_KEY: Replace \"Enter your printer\" with your OctoPrint API key.\n",
    "        OCTOPRINT_URL: Enter your printer's IP address.\n",
    "        GCODE_URL: Provide the endpoint to retrieve the G-code file.\n",
    "        folder_path: Specify the path for storing images and CSV files.\n",
    "    -Ensure the Raspberry Pi Camera is properly installed and configured.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the Script\n",
    "## To start collecting data:\n",
    "Run the script:\n",
    "bash use code: 'python3 script_name.py'\n",
    "The script will continuously check the printer status. Once the printer starts printing, it will begin capturing images and logging data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Folder Structure\n",
    "A new folder is created with a unique timestamp for each printing session, containing:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Photos of the print at each interval.\n",
    "    A CSV file named timelapse_log.csv, storing each image's file location, timestamp, and G-code command.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "    -get_printer_status: Retrieves the printer’s current status (e.g., Printing, Paused).\n",
    "    -get_current_gcode: Fetches the G-code command currently being executed.\n",
    "    -capture_photo: Captures and saves a photo from the camera.\n",
    "    -log_to_csv: Records photo location, timestamp, and G-code to a CSV file.\n",
    "    -start_timelapse: Begins the timelapse when printing starts.\n",
    "    -rotate_image_180: Rotates the captured image for correct orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "    Error with OctoPrint connection: Ensure the API key and URL are correctly set.\n",
    "    Camera not capturing: Verify the camera is properly installed and configured.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Output\n",
    "The script outputs photos and logs like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Photos: image_2024-10-10_13-51-53.jpg\n",
    "CSV:\n",
    "photo_location,timestamp,gcode\n",
    "/home/user/camera_project/2024-10-10-13-51-48_output/image_2024-10-10_13-51-53.jpg,2024-10-10_13-51-53,G1 X32.00002 Y-40.005591 Z1.516854 E2 F1500 "
